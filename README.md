# caseflow
CaseFlow is an internal case management system designed to handle client intake, case tracking, and real-time collaboration for small teams.

The application allows authenticated users to create clients, manage cases, track status changes, and append internal notes through an audit-friendly, append-only log. Real-time updates ensure all connected users stay in sync without manual refreshes.

CaseFlow is built as a full-stack application using Flask and PostgreSQL on the backend, with a lightweight React frontend consuming a REST API and live update stream.
